Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm JoÃ£o Victor, also known as Haru02w ðŸ˜Ž.

In this blog, I will post about things I have learnt throughout my life,
as well as explanation on some complex projects I still want to make.

Those things include:
- Games
- Web Servers
- Emulator / Virtual Machines
- Compilers / Programming Languages
- Web APIs
- Operatinal Systems
- Much more (anything that takes my interest, honestly ðŸ˜ƒ)

I'm not really used to write my thoughts out like that, even more so in English, which is not my first language.
If you find something weird, mispelled, or anything like that, please, say it in the comments section!

This blog is made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). Check out their project!
It's really easy to get up and running with your own Static Websites with it.
